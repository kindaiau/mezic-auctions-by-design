## Resolution Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Current branch is up to date with main
2. ‚úÖ No conflict markers exist in the working directory
3. ‚úÖ Main branch is clean and ready for merges

### Recommended Merge Order
To minimize conflicts, PRs should be merged in this order:

1. **PR #18** (Documentation only - no code conflicts)
2. **PR #10** (Single file, single line change - minimal impact)
3. **PR #8** (UI changes to App.tsx and Hero.tsx)
4. **PR #17** (ChatGPT integration - adds new files)
5. **PR #12** (Auction metadata - significant changes, requires careful review)
6. **PR #13** (Mock auction handling - depends on PR #12 being merged first)
7. **PR #14** (Loading states - should be merged after auction changes stabilize)

### How to Resolve Conflicts

For PR authors/maintainers:

```bash
# Example for PR #12
git checkout codex/extend-auction-interface-with-new-fields
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Then force push (if you have permissions)
git push -f origin codex/extend-auction-interface-with-new-fields
```

For maintainers who cannot directly push to PR branches:
1. Close conflicting PRs and ask authors to rebase
2. OR manually merge the changes into main in the recommended order
3. OR create new branches with resolved conflicts and open new PRs

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Working directory is clean (no conflict markers)
- ‚úÖ Main branch is stable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple PRs need rebasing onto current main
- ‚ùå At least one PR (#12) has confirmed merge conflicts

## Next Steps
1. PR authors should rebase their branches onto `f944e2f`
2. PR #12 specifically needs conflict resolution
3. Follow the recommended merge order to minimize additional conflicts
4. Test each PR individually after rebasing before merging
