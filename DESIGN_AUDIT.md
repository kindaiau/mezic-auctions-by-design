# Mezic Auctions UI Audit

## Overview
- Hero typography now drives action with clear CTAs, tightening the conversion story from the first scroll.
- Updated color tokens return the interface to its charcoal-and-gold intention, restoring contrast across dark sections.
- Signup experience benefits from the corrected palette but still needs secondary accessibility validation (keyboard focus and screen-reader labels).

## Strengths
- Large-format hero typography and logo pairing create an immediate brand impression, now paired with primary/secondary CTAs for momentum. (`Hero.tsx`)
- Auction cards use consistent spacing and clear CTA hierarchy for bidding actions while aligning to the shared spacing scale. (`Auctions.tsx`)
- Signup flow anticipates success/error handling with toasts and success state. (`EmailSignup.tsx`)
- Charcoal gradients and gallery black panels now render with true depth, helping artwork imagery pop. (`KierkegaardGrid.tsx`)

## Issues & Opportunities
1. **Token contrast QA** – Palette variables now output correct hues, but run them through contrast tooling to certify AA/AAA coverage on all text + background pairings (especially gold on charcoal). (`src/index.css`)
2. **Focus treatment** – Buttons and inputs use the default focus ring; consider a custom gold-accented outline to reinforce the refreshed palette. (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`)
3. **Form semantics** – Signup form offers success states but lacks aria-live messaging for async feedback, which would improve assistive tech clarity. (`src/components/EmailSignup.tsx`)
4. **Motion balance** – Hero now stacks two CTAs; evaluate easing/delay so both feel equally discoverable on mobile (perhaps staggered fade-in). (`src/components/Hero.tsx`)

## Recommendations
- Validate the updated palette with automated contrast tests (Stark, Polypane, or tailwindcss-accessibility) to close the loop on the new tokens.
- Swap focus rings to a custom gold/white dual ring so keyboard users experience the same elevated polish as pointer users.
- Announce async states in the signup form via `aria-live="polite"` and add success/failure messaging to the DOM for screen readers.
- Stagger hero CTAs with micro animation or differentiate button hierarchy (primary vs secondary) to clarify the recommended path.
