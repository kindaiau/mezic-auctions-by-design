# Conflict Resolution Summary - PR #23 Integration

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Branch:** `copilot/resolve-qa-audit-conflicts`  
**Target PR:** #23 (Comprehensive QA Audit)

## Overview

Successfully resolved conflicts and integrated all improvements from PR #23 ("Comprehensive QA Audit: Fix critical accessibility, validation, and UX issues across all interactive components") into the current working branch.

## What Was Done

### 1. Conflict Analysis
- Identified that PR #23 was based on an older commit (`f94750a`) while current main was at `2ac8b8b`
- Found conflicts in `src/components/EmailSignup.tsx` due to formatting differences (minified vs expanded JSX)

### 2. Cherry-Pick Strategy
Used `git cherry-pick` to apply commits from PR #23:
- Commit `31cf335`: Add comprehensive form validation, ARIA labels, and accessibility improvements
- Commit `334ee38`: Add comprehensive QA audit report and final documentation

### 3. Conflict Resolution
Resolved conflicts in `EmailSignup.tsx` by:
- Accepting the properly formatted, accessibility-enhanced version from PR #23
- Preserving all accessibility improvements (autocomplete, aria-invalid, aria-describedby)
- Maintaining the enhanced focus states with `focus-visible:ring-artist-gold/50`
